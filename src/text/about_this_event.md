## About this event

This free one-day workshop will include presentations from practising health and
life scientists, success stories of more environmentally-friendly computing and
group discussions. Topics will include the carbon footprint of
high-performance computing, energy-efficient data processing pipelines, and the
benefits of efficient programming.

By attending this event, you will:

- Learn how to reduce the carbon footprint of your own research computing, also
giving you the ability to feed these insights back to your institution.

- Debate what barriers to sustainable computing exist and work towards
potential solutions.

- Network with other health and life sciences researchers interested in
reducing the carbon footprint of their computing, providing new opportunities
for collaboration.

- Contribute to an emerging community of climate-conscious scientists.

We are holding the workshop in person to facilitate discussion and debate, and
bursaries are available to support attendees who wouldn't be able to join
otherwise (more on this below).
In addition, to maximise accessibility, this event will be hybrid, with an option to
join via video conferencing, including a live stream, and opportunities to ask
questions and engage in group discussion.
