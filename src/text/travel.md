## Travel

We have limited funds available to support travel to the workshop for
those who may struggle to cover the necessary funds and/or are
travelling a long distance. To apply for a travel bursary, please

to provide some information and demonstrate how these funds would help
you. The funds can include support for 1 night accommodation.
Wherever possible, we encourage attendees to travel in a
climate-responsible way, using public transport.
