## Post-workshop

Thank you to everyone who attended the first EIC workshop. We hope you enjoyed it
as much as we did.

Copies of all the presentations are available under [resources](#resources) and
recordings of the presentations will be available soon.

In the meantime, we are building a community focused on promoting
environmentally sustainable computational research. To join, please fill out the

__The first Environmental Impacts of Computing in Health & Life Sciences
Research Workshop will take place on the 7th of November, 2023.__

**When:** 7th of November, 2023 from 10am to 4pm GMT

**Where:** Wellcome Trust (London, UK) and online

**Format:** Hybrid (in person and online), free (registration required)

Research has a large role to play in combating the climate crisis, but research
processes also have a significant carbon footprint. Computations in particular
are now an integral part of research in health and life sciences, but also come
with large and underestimated environmental costs. When considering computer
manufacturing, and the energy required to store and process data, it becomes
crucial to acknowledge and mitigate the contribution of our research to climate
change. 

The ICT sector (Information and Communication Technologies) is
responsible for an [*estimated 1.8-3.9% of global greenhouse gas
emissions*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340), more than the
aviation sector. Data centres around the world have a yearly carbon footprint of
around 100 MT CO<sub>2</sub>e, equivalent to US commercial aviation. Since
the impact from computing of a single life science experiment can reach tonnes
of CO<sub>2</sub>e, it becomes crucial that we acknowledge and mitigate the
impacts of our work. And as the people who best understand our own work, we are
ideally placed to do so. 

As the need for computational power in research grows, including increasing
adoption of AI tools, **we must address the challenges and opportunities in making
scientific research computing more sustainable**.
