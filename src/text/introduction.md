__We are excited to announce the first Environmental impacts of computing in health
& life sciences research workshop!
It will take place on the 7th of November, 2023, from 10am to 4pm GMT in a hybrid format
at the Wellcome Trust (London, UK) and online.__

Research has a large role to play in combating the climate crisis but also has a
significant carbon footprint.
Computations in particular are now an integral part of research in health and
life sciences, but also come with large and underestimated environmental costs.
When considering computer manufacturing, and the energy required to store and
process data, it becomes crucial to acknowledge and mitigate the contribution
of our research to climate change.
The ICT sector (Information and Communication Technologies) is responsible for an
[*estimated 1.8-3.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340),
more than the aviation sector. Data centres around the world have a yearly carbon footprint
of around 100 MT CO<sub>2</sub>e, equivalent to the US commercial aviation.
Since the impact from computing of a single life science experiments can reach tonnes
of CO<sub>2</sub>e, it becomes crucial that we acknowledge and mitigate the impacts
of our work. And as the people who best understand our own work, we are ideally placed
to do so. As the need for computational power in
research grows, including increasing adoption of AI tools, we must address the
challenges and opportunities in making scientific research computing more sustainable.

## About this event

This one-day workshop will include presentations from experts, success stories
of environmentally-friendly computing and group discussions. The topics will
include the carbon footprint of high-performance computing, energy-efficient
data processing pipelines, and the benefits of efficient programming.

By attending this event, you will:

-   Learn how to reduce the carbon footprint of your own research computing
using diverse approaches, giving you the ability to feed these insights back to
your institution.

- Debate what  barriers to sustainable computing exist and work towards
potential solutions.

-   Network with other health and life sciences researchers interested in
reducing the carbon footprint of their computing, providing new opportunities
for collaboration.

-   Contribute to an emerging community of climate-conscious scientists.

We are holding the workshop in person to facilitate discussion and debate, and
bursaries are available to support attendees who wouldn't be able to join
otherwise (more on this below).
Besides, to maximise accessibility, this event will be hybrid, with an option to
join via video conferencing, including a live stream, and opportunities to ask
questions and engage in group discussion.

## Who is it for?

This workshop is primarily aimed at researchers in the life sciences (e.g.
neuroscience, biology, biochemistry, genetics) who use demanding algorithms
for their work (i.e. algorithms that run for several hours and/or using
supercomputers). It will also be relevant to researchers from other
fields of science who rely on computations, or for stakeholders involved with
computational research in any capacity.

For example, if your computing usage is mostly word/excel/web browser, then
computing is probably a minor part of your carbon footprint and this may not
be the most relevant to you (but you are very welcome if you're interested in
the topic anyway!).

Importantly, you don't need any prior knowledge in sustainability to come,
or expertise in computer science. An interest in reducing the carbon footprint
of your research is all you need!
