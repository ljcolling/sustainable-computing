__The first Environmental Impacts of Computing in Health & Life Sciences
Research Workshop will take place on the 7th of November, 2023.__

**When:** 7th of November, 2023 from 10am to 4pm GMT

**Where:** Wellcome Trust (London, UK) and online

**Format:** Hybrid (in person and online), free (registration required)

Research has a large role to play in combating the climate crisis, but research
processes also have a significant carbon footprint. Computations in particular
are now an integral part of research in health and life sciences, but also come
with large and underestimated environmental costs. When considering computer
manufacturing, and the energy required to store and process data, it becomes
crucial to acknowledge and mitigate the contribution of our research to climate
change. 

The ICT sector (Information and Communication Technologies) is
responsible for an [*estimated 1.8-3.9% of global greenhouse gas
emissions*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340), more than the
aviation sector. Data centres around the world have a yearly carbon footprint of
around 100 MT CO<sub>2</sub>e, equivalent to US commercial aviation. Since
the impact from computing of a single life science experiment can reach tonnes
of CO<sub>2</sub>e, it becomes crucial that we acknowledge and mitigate the
impacts of our work. And as the people who best understand our own work, we are
ideally placed to do so. 

As the need for computational power in research grows, including increasing
adoption of AI tools, **we must address the challenges and opportunities in making
scientific research computing more sustainable**.

## About this event

This free one-day workshop will include presentations from practising health and
life scientists, success stories of more environmentally-friendly computing and
group discussions. Topics will include the carbon footprint of
high-performance computing, energy-efficient data processing pipelines, and the
benefits of efficient programming.

By attending this event, you will:

- Learn how to reduce the carbon footprint of your own research computing, also
giving you the ability to feed these insights back to your institution.

- Debate what barriers to sustainable computing exist and work towards
potential solutions.

- Network with other health and life sciences researchers interested in
reducing the carbon footprint of their computing, providing new opportunities
for collaboration.

- Contribute to an emerging community of climate-conscious scientists.

We are holding the workshop in person to facilitate discussion and debate, and
bursaries are available to support attendees who wouldn't be able to join
otherwise (more on this below).
In addition, to maximise accessibility, this event will be hybrid, with an option to
join via video conferencing, including a live stream, and opportunities to ask
questions and engage in group discussion.
