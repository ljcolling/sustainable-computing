## Who is it for?

This workshop is for researchers in the health and life sciences (e.g.
neuroimaging, biology, biochemistry, genetics) who use heavy computational
resources for their work (i.e. analyses that run for several hours and/or use
institutional servers). It will also be relevant to researchers from other
fields of science who rely on heavy computation, or for stakeholders involved with
academic research that relies on heavy computation (e.g. funders, institutional
IT service providers).

On the other hand, if your computing usage is mostly word/excel/web browser, then
computing is probably a minor part of your carbon footprint and this may not
be the most relevant to you (but you are very welcome if you're interested in
the topic anyway!).

Importantly, you don't need any prior knowledge of sustainability to come,
or expertise in computer science. An interest in reducing the carbon footprint
of your research is all you need!


If you have any questions, please contact the workshop organiser Dr Nick Souter at

and we look forward to seeing you on 7th November.
